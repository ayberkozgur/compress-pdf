compress-pdf
============

Little bash script for compressing pdf files using gs.

To install on a Debian-based system using, run (you need `cmake` and `checkinstall`):

```
sudo ./install.sh
```

To uninstall, run:

```
sudo dpkg --remove compress-pdf
```

Why `cmake` when there is no `c++` you ask? Why not? CMake is a great tool to install code or binaries from any language with or without compilation.
